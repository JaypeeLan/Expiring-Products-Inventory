[Live Preview](https://expiring-prod-inventory.netlify.app/)
### About This Project
So i have a friend who is a caterer. She complains about having to buy to buy new ingredients almost everything she wants to prepare something because they are either expired or she just guess that what she has at home is expired already. I got this idea of what of what if i create something like a calender where she can just write down the expiring date of each ingredient she gets so she can lookup and see what she only needs to get before she goes to the market.

### Documentation
- Input the name of the item.
- Input the expiring date of the item then click on the log item button.
The days left for the item to expire is calculated and displayed below. The status is okay is the days left for the item to expires is more than five(5) days. Once the days for the item to expire is less than 5, the background color of that particular item becomes red, and the status changes from **okay** to **consider replacing**.

### What I learned
- First time using local storage, i got a really good grasp of it
- Played around with javascript in-built date object and how to format it to useful data
- Refactored my code and used the best practices possible
